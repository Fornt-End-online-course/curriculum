## HTML Editors

# What is an HTML editor?

An **HTML editor** is any tool you use to write HTML (and usually CSS/JS). Editors range from tiny text editors to full IDEs and cloud-based playgrounds. The editor you choose shapes how fast and happily you build websites.

# Types of editors (short & useful)

1.  **Text editors** — lightweight, fast. Examples: Sublime Text, Notepad++. Great for simple projects and fast editing.
    
2.  **Code editors (modern)** — balance speed + features (integrated extensions). Example: **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code). These are the most popular for front-end work. VS Code even includes Emmet (expansion/snippets) built in. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/emmet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3.  **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** — heavyweight, full feature set (debugger, refactorings, VCS integration). Example: **WebStorm** (JetBrains). Powerful for large projects and team workflows. [JetBrains+1](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/editing-html-files.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
4.  **Online editors / playgrounds** — run in the browser, great for prototyping and sharing (CodePen, CodeSandbox, JSFiddle, Replit). Useful for demos, quick tests, and collaboration. [Refine+1](https://refine.dev/blog/6-best-online-code-editors-comparison/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
5.  **WYSIWYG / CMS editors** — TinyMCE, CKEditor — for content editing rather than coding. (Use when you need non-coder content entry.)

# What to look for in an HTML editor (features that matter)

-   **Syntax highlighting & autocomplete** (HTML/CSS/JS).
    
-   **Emmet** support (abbreviation expansion) — HUGE time-saver. VS Code has it built-in. 
-   **Live preview / Live Server** — edit → see changes immediately in the browser.
    
-   **Built-in terminal & Git integration** (commit/push without leaving editor).
    
-   **Formatter & Linter** (Prettier, ESLint) — keeps code consistent.
    
-   **Extensions / plugin ecosystem** — linters, snippets, icons, frameworks support.
    
-   **Debugging & DevTools integration** (IDEs often excel here). 
-   **Performance** — editor should stay snappy for large projects.
    
-   **Project templates / project management** (for speed).

### Essential extensions / plugins (quick list)

(If you choose **VS Code**, add these)

-   **Live Server** — automatic live reload in browser.
    
-   **Prettier** — code formatter.
### When to pick an IDE (like WebStorm) vs code editor

-   Choose an **IDE** when you want deep language support, advanced refactoring's, integrated debugging, database tools, and heavy project workflows. WebStorm is a top choice for JS/TS heavy teams. 

-   Choose **VS Code** when you want flexibility, speed, and a huge extension ecosystem (free and extensible).
