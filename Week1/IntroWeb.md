# Introduction To Web 

When most of us talk about using the "internet", we're typically talking about a very specific part of the internet: the World Wide Web (WWW, or simply "web").

The web is a massive network of webpages and media, connected to each other through links, and accessible via URLs.

## **Main elements in web** 
-   **Client**: The browser sends requests.
    
-   **Server**: Receives the request and sends a response (HTML/CSS/JS).
    
-   **HTTP/HTTPs**: The protocol for transferring data.
 
üëâ **Flow**: Browser ‚Üí Request ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Render Page.

## Website
A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.

There are more than 2 billion websites on the internet today. Every website is written in **HTML**, and our personal computers can view those websites thanks to **HTTP**.
# Web Development

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications that run in a web browser. It combines programming, design, and server management to create websites that are functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing.


Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its main parts:

1.  Frontend Development (Client-side)  
      
    -   What users see and interact with on a website (layout, design, buttons, forms, animations, etc.).  

	-   Uses languages like HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity).  
      
    
	-   Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular.  
      
    

2.  Backend Development (Server-side)  

	-   Handles the ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù logic, databases, authentication, and server communication.  

	-  	Uses languages like Python, PHP, Java, Node.js, Ruby, Go.  
      
    
	-   Manages data storage (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
      
    
3.  Full-Stack Development  
     
	-   A developer who works on both frontend and backend.  
      
    

4.  Web Design & UI/UX  

	- Focuses on user experience and creating an appealing, intuitive interface.  
      
    

5.  DevOps & Deployment  

	-   Involves hosting websites, managing servers, scaling applications, and automating workflows.

# Static Vs Dynamic Websites

### Static website

A _static_ website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (**HTML**); Cascading Style Sheets (**CSS**) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML.

### Dynamic website

A _dynamic_ website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically.

Dynamic websites contain Web pages that are generated in real-time. When a dynamic page is accessed, the code within the page is parsed on the Web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's Web browser.

Dynamic pages, access information from a **database**.
